Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

Directions
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

Create the following files files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:
A navbar
A responsive layout
Responsive images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.
Screenshots are provided as a reference in the Assets/Images folder. Your app does not need to be exactly like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

Bonus

Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation).


Commit Early and Often
One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:


Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.


Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.


Follow these guidelines for committing:


Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.


Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.


Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).


Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.


We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
